# Roadmap to Securing an SDE Role at Google, Meta, or LinkedIn (Oct–Dec 2025)

This concise roadmap outlines the steps to land an SDE I/II role at Google, Meta, or LinkedIn by Q4 2025, focusing on technical preparation, behavioral skills, resume optimization, networking, and applications. It assumes ~15 hours/week for prep and leverages your 300+ LeetCode problems and ~2 years at Zoho.

## Technical Preparation

### Advanced Algorithms & Data Structures
- **Focus**: Master complex patterns for FAANG-level interviews.
- **Topics**:
  - **Graphs**: BFS/DFS, Dijkstra’s, topological sort, union-find (e.g., Number of Islands, Course Schedule).
  - **Dynamic Programming**: 1D/2D DP, recurrence relations (e.g., Coin Change, Longest Common Subsequence).
  - **Backtracking**: Combinatorial problems with pruning (e.g., N-Queens, Permutations).
  - **Sliding Window/Two-Pointers**: Subarray/string problems (e.g., Longest Substring, Two Sum).
  - **Advanced**: Bit manipulation, concurrency (e.g., thread-safe designs), tries.
- **Practice**: Solve 50–60 problems/month (mix of medium/hard). Use Blind 75, NeetCode, LeetCode Patterns. Analyze time/space complexity and alternatives.
- **Resources**: Tech Interview Handbook, InterviewBit, CodeSignal.

### System Design
- **Depth**: SDE I needs basic familiarity; SDE II requires deeper knowledge.
- **Low-Level Design (LLD)**: Practice OOP (SOLID principles, design patterns) for systems like Parking Lot, Library Management. Write pseudo-code/classes.
- **High-Level Design (HLD)**: Learn scalable architecture (load balancers, caching, sharding). Design systems like URL Shortener, News Feed. Discuss trade-offs.
- **Practice**: 1–2 design problems/week (45–60 min simulations). Draw diagrams, justify choices.
- **Resources**: Grokking System Design (Design Gurus), System Design Primer (GitHub), Head First Design Patterns.

### CS Fundamentals
- **Topics**:
  - **OS**: Processes/threads, concurrency, memory management (e.g., deadlocks, scheduling).
  - **DBMS**: ACID, indexing, SQL vs. NoSQL, normalization.
  - **Networking**: HTTP, DNS, TCP/IP, CDN, latency vs. bandwidth.
  - **OOP**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, design patterns.
- **Prep**: Review 1–2 weeks, focus on common interview questions. Create cheat sheets.
- **Resources**: GeeksforGeeks, Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces, Nail Your Interview CS Guide.

### Mock Interviews
- **Frequency**: 1–2/week (coding, system design, behavioral) starting July.
- **Platforms**: Pramp (free), Interviewing.io (paid), AMAinterview (AI). Solo timed simulations (30–45 min).
- **Goal**: Improve communication, speed, and confidence. Track feedback in a journal.
- **Tip**: Record solo practice to refine clarity, reduce filler words.

## Behavioral & Communication Skills

### STAR Method
- **Structure**: Situation (context), Task (responsibility), Action (your steps), Result (outcome, quantified).
- **Stories**: Prepare 6–8 stories covering teamwork, leadership, conflict, failure, success, ambiguity. Use Zoho examples (e.g., improved load time by 30%, resolved team conflict).
- **Practice**: Write STAR bullets, rehearse aloud, record for fluency. Aim for 2–3 min/story.

### Common Questions
- Teamwork: Cross-functional collaboration, difficult teammate.
- Leadership: Initiative without authority, project challenges.
- Failure: Mistakes, lessons learned.
- Success: Quantifiable impact (e.g., automated process, saved 5 hours/week).
- Adaptability: Ambiguity, changing requirements.

### Practice
- **Mocks**: Use Pramp, Interviewing.io for behavioral rounds. Peer practice with feedback.
- **Tools**: STAR worksheets, ChatGPT for question generation/critique.
- **Delivery**: Improve English clarity via recordings, reduce filler words, maintain eye contact (virtual).

## Resume & LinkedIn Optimization

### Resume
- **Format**: 1-page, clean, bullet-based. Use X-Y-Z formula: “Accomplished X by Y, resulting in Z.”
- **Content**:
  - Zoho: Highlight impact (e.g., “Optimized APIs, cut response time by 40%”). Use action verbs (Developed, Led).
  - Skills: Java, Go, Python, AWS, Docker, etc. Match job description keywords.
  - Projects: 1–2 side projects (e.g., React app with CI/CD).
- **Review**: Use Resume Worded, CVCompiler, or colleagues for feedback.

### LinkedIn
- **Profile**:
  - Headline: “Software Engineer at Zoho | Seeking SDE Roles.”
  - Summary: Highlight skills, goals (e.g., “2 years building full-stack apps, proficient in Java/Go, seeking SDE roles”).
  - Skills: Pin Software Development, Java, Cloud Computing. Seek endorsements.
- **Activity**: Comment on company posts, share learning updates (#softwareengineering). Use “Open to Work.”
- **Networking**: Connect with alumni, Google/Meta/LinkedIn employees. Engage before requesting referrals.

### Referrals
- **Strategy**: Identify 10–12 contacts by July. Message with personalized notes (e.g., shared college, interest in their team). Build rapport before asking.
- **Request**: “I’m applying for SDE II at [Company]. My Go/AWS experience aligns well. Could you refer me? Resume attached.”

## Application Strategy

### Timing
- **Apply**: Late Aug–early Sep 2025 (peak hiring season).
- **Process**:
  - Google: 6–8 weeks (phone screens, 4–5 onsite rounds).
  - Meta: 4–8 weeks (phone screens, 3–4 onsite, team matching).
  - LinkedIn: 4–6 weeks (fewer rounds, emphasis on culture fit).
- **Avoid**: Mid-Nov–Dec slowdown. Aim for offers by Oct–Dec.

### Channels
- **Referrals**: Priority channel. Coordinate with referrers, apply via company portal.
- **Careers Pages**: Tailor resume to job postings. Apply to SDE I/II roles.
- **Recruiters**: Message on LinkedIn with resume.
- **Portals**: Complete HackerRank/Codility tests promptly.

### Follow-Ups
